# Hi, I'm Luca! :wave:


# About Me


I'm a student at the University of Notre Dame studying math and computing. I'm especially interested now in real analysis and PDEs, numerical methods, machine learning, and computer science fundamentals/algorithms. I'm excited to learn more about the intersection of these areas! When I'm not writing code or working through proofs, you can find me marching with the Band of the Fighting Irish, in the gym, or learning the bass guitar.
